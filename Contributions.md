## Cameron Warnick  
• Learned how the hardware functions and conducted preliminary project research, despite hardware-based projects being outside my field of specialization.  
• Wrote the entire Project Proposal.  
• Contributed to the Button Design and Requirements Template.  
• Refactored the initial code base: WebserverButtons.ino: also involved researching a completely new domain of programming until I actually understood how it works through-and-through.  
• Built a prototype in bare HTML/CSS for the digital interface.  
• First redesign of the project interface: created a separate stylesheet, restyled and rebuilt the entire HTML/CSS layout, and tediously converted it to print statements.  
• Built another HTML/CSS prototype and tediously converted it to serial print statements. Second redesign of the interface: changed the interface style to support five buttons and extended the logic to use five buttons.  Streamlined the existing UI logic.  
• Wrote all of the R1 UI Documentation.  
• Built a third HTML/CSS prototype.  Third redesign of the interface: moved from serial print statements to actual HTML/CSS, completely revamped the entire design, mapped buttons to an image of the product, used extensive media queries to make it responsive, and created a new menu to display the state for each button.  
• Researched the JS Fetch API to handle completely new constraints for the application.  Now, the central methodology we were using (rerouting based on button clicks to manage state) was no longer valid, as we changed the overarching medium we were working with.  This was a huge curveball and required a complete rethinking of the project in addition to the third redesign.  Notably, there is no handbook that tells you how to solve this problem: I just had to figure something out, in a completely unfamiliar domain.  
• Modified the system to use HTTP queries in a JavaScript section within the HTML file to manage button state updates and track state based on user input.  
• Fourth redesign, revamped entire website HTML / CSS structure  
• Used a new technique to fix button positions on toy image with only one CSS rule.  
• Used images of the buttons themselves overlaid on the toy image buttons, making the application look significantly better.  
• Added button-highlight mode  
• Added image expand mode  
• Added new menu to control accessibility features  
• Revamped heading, added new tagline  
• Revamped background: moving colored gradient with dark filter overlaid, keeping it un-intrusive while highlighting interactive elements.  
• Re-implemented glowing buttons, added a dynamic gradient for the title (PlayPal).   
• Refactored HTML/CSS layout  
• Added "move" and "dance" buttons
